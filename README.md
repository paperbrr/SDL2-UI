A simple button for SDL2 projects :D

Features ->
1) Custom color for your button
2) Freedom to define its dimensions
3) Option to assign a custom event when it is clicked
4) An array of all buttons created for easy tracking

Make sure to use the ```freeButtonArray``` at the end of your program to prevent memory leaks!
